# Dumpsterfire Pages

Base package for Dumpsterfire framework

### Resources:
- dumpsterfire-pages (this repo!)
- [create-dumpsterfire-app](https://github.com/cheerios4316/create-dumpsterfire-app/)
- [poteriforti](https://github.com/cheerios4316/poteriforti)


### Introduction

This is the source code for the `dumpsterfire-pages` composer package (soon to be published on Packagist).

Some of the features (proper doc is WIP):
- Automatic DI container
- Dynamic routing
- Components and page components, with easy to extend renderers
- Easy to extend base object to read data from DB
- Front end logic for components, manageable with Typescript.
- Two default controller types (BaseController for pages and ApiController for JSON data)

Note that the project is still in its early stages, therefore many things lack important features.
This is not ready to be used in production for anything that is not strictly front-end.

### Usage

Please see [the README for create-dumpsterfire-app](https://github.com/cheerios4316/create-dumpsterfire-app/)
